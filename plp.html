  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>The primary goal of the Philosophy Honor Society is to provide philosophy to all, to make it easily accessible, and to spread
    knowledge of its existence to those who may do well with it.
  </p>
  <p>To find out more about this goal, and how chapters are supposed to
    accomplish it, you can read the Phi Lambda Phi constitution <Button onclick="selectPaper('PLPCONST')"><a href="display.html">here</a></Button>: outlining the general goals and procedures of a member chapter</p>

  <h2>Standard Curriculum</h2>
    <p>If you have already made a chapter and would like to introduce the subject of philosophy to your members, as is a part of Phi Lambda Phi's goal, a standard
    curriculum has been created with lecture notes based on various subjects in modern philosophy. Give it a try, and if you would like to explore more in-depth topics, 
    there are plenty of lecture notes from formal courses available online, or you can create your own based on your members' needs. </p>

    <p>The Standard Curriculum can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EZDLBRngbt7xfxseBzmUJSpYzAhdHIJ3?usp=sharing">here</a>. </p>

    <p> If you would like, the standard curriculum can be previewed from this website. Here are the notes in intended order:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><Button onclick="selectPaper('THEP')"><a href="display.html">The Philosophy</a></Button></li>
        <li><Button onclick="selectPaper('ONEPIS')"><a href="display.html">On Epistemology</a></Button></li>
