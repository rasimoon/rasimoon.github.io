<h2>Selected Research.</h2>

<p><b>Adaptive Lexicons for Sentiment Analysis Using Basic Subset Emotional Adaptations </b> - Dated: 2024-current - Page: <Button onclick="selectPaper('')"><a href="display.html">Not Yet Available</a></Button> </p>
<p>Abstract:  The following work evaluates the extent to which emotional adaptations of an entire subset of emotional categories bring accurate generalizations to lexicon-based sentiment analysis tasks. 
  First, we introduce a linear system for categorizing the emotions based on their yield of pleasure or displeasure, then we introduce a technique for generalizing this method to multiple contexts by providing basic rules that govern the 
  transformation of subsets of the lexicon (which are determined via their emotional weight given prior), transferring them to other subsets in the process of adaptation based on the specified context e.g. all words that evoke a somewhat displeasurable sense of 
  excitement are transferred to the subset of a somewhat pleasurable sense of excitement upon the identification of the context being movies.

</p>
<p>Impact: This research is intended to address novel ideas about computational linguistics that could make simple
  sentiment analysis systems more accessible and accurate overall, paving the way for a future with increased emotional clarity.

<h2>Selected Essays in Philosophy.</h2>
    
<p><b>Essence of Humanity</b> - Dated: 2024 - Page: <Button onclick="selectPaper('EOH')"><a href="display.html">Here</a></Button> </p>
<p>Abstract:  The following essay investigates imagination as being central to the human essence, or what it is to be and feel 
    like a human. First, imagination is formulated as prevalent only through desire. 
    Then, desire and imagination are correlated such that the strength of imagination is proportional to 
    the degree one desires. This correlation is proven to determine a classification system for how much imagination
     beings possess based on their basic desires and potential for complex desires. This then allows differentiation between 
     “animals” and humans by postulating that only humans can follow higher-order desires, and thus be able to form strong, complex
      desires in stability. Therefore, the conclusion is reached that humans are fundamentally different from animals because 
      of their ability to imagine to a “higher degree”.</p>
<p>Impact: As a speculative work, 'Essence of Humanity' is meant to introduce a new hypothesis into epistemology and the broader
    field of philosophy that allows for the definitive classification of humans in comparison to other living species, therefore answering
the important question as to what exactly is a 'human'. </p>

<p><b>Philosophy for the Practical Man</b> - Dated: 2024 - Page: <Button onclick="selectPaper('PPM')"><a href="display.html">Here</a></Button> </p>
<p>Abstract:  A short essay exploring the academic subject of philosophy as more suitable for hobbyists (or "practical men"), as opposed
to academic professionals.</p>
<p>Impact: The short essay is meant to inspire hobbyists and professionals to explore the subject in an artistic way that is meaningful, rather than
in a way that simply glorifies it and its past practitioners.</p>

<p>Abstract: On the urgent matter of getting young democrats to understand and interpret information as well as the perspectives of 
  others properly. The main thesis is that the democratic party, no less any political party, will be able to survive in extremism, and

  these demands with the party's historical desires.
