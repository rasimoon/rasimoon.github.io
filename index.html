<h2>Selected Essays in Philosophy.</h2>
    
<p><b>Essence of Humanity</b> - Dated: 2024 - Page: <Button onclick="selectPaper('EOH')"><a href="display.html">Here</a></Button> </p>
<p>Abstract:  The following essay investigates imagination as being central to the human essence, or what it is to be and feel 
    like a human. First, imagination is formulated as prevalent only through desire. 
    Then, desire and imagination are correlated such that the strength of imagination is proportional to 
    the degree one desires. This correlation is proven to determine a classification system for how much imagination
     beings possess based on their basic desires and potential for complex desires. This then allows differentiation between 
     “animals” and humans by postulating that only humans can follow higher-order desires, and thus be able to form strong, complex
      desires in stability. Therefore, the conclusion is reached that humans are fundamentally different from animals because 
      of their ability to imagine to a “higher degree”.</p>
<p>Impact: As a speculative work, 'Essence of Humanity' is meant to introduce a new hypothesis into epistemology and the broader
    field of philosophy that allows for the definitive classification of humans in comparison to other living species, therefore answering
the important question as to what exactly is a 'human'. </p>

<p><b>Philosophy for the Practical Man</b> - Dated: 2024 - Page: <Button onclick="selectPaper('PPM')"><a href="display.html">Here</a></Button> </p>
<p>Abstract:  A short essay exploring the academic subject of philosophy as more suitable for hobbyists (or "practical men"), as opposed
to academic professionals.</p>
<p>Impact: The short essay is meant to inspire hobbyists and professionals to explore the subject in an artistic way that is meaningful, rather than
in a way that simply glorifies it and its past practitioners.</p>

<h2>Political Op-Eds and Essays</h2>

<p><b>Democrats! See no Evil, Hear no Evil, Speak no Evil</b> - Dated: 2025 - Page: <Button onclick="selectPaper('SEHESE')"><a href="display.html">Here</a></Button> </p>
<p>Abstract: On the urgent matter of getting young democrats to understand and interpret information as well as the perspectives of 
  others properly. The main thesis is that the democratic party, no less any political party, will be able to survive in extremism, and
  in order to put their ambitions into effect, they must learn how to properly listen to the demands of the people and how to reconcile
  these demands with the party's historical desires.
</p>
<p>Impact: Acknowledging the weakness in extremism and blindness to outside opinion is crucial for a successful political campaign. This op-ed hopes to inspire young democrats to change the course of the party's history through global consideration.  </p>

<p><b>Democrats are Leaving their own Behind with Texas</b> - Dated: 2025 - Page: <Button onclick="selectPaper('DALTOB')"><a href="display.html">Here</a></Button> </p>
<p>Abstract: Democrats didn't just leave the state of Texas, they also abandoned the Texan democrats by not standing up for them and 
  ceded control to the republican party by running when it mattered most. 
</p>
<p>Impact: This op-ed is written with the hope that democrats will learn that compromise, however small it may be, is better
  than making "bold" moves that accomplish nothing but provoking false revelry.  </p>

<h2>Selected Projects.</h2>
<!--<p><b>The Moon, Nebulae, and Quasars</b> - Dated: 2025-present - Page: </p>
<p>Abstract: A documentation of my journey to preparing for the International Physics Olympiad, becoming an astrophysicist, and beyond. This
    blog features educational...
</p>
<p>Impact: Provides an efficient and convenient solution to at-home energy usage capable of curbing harmful environmental trends. </p>-->

<p><b>Physlet Software</b> - Dated: 2025-present - Page: <a href="https://github.com/rasimoon/Physlet">https://github.com/rasimoon/Physlet</a> </p>
<p>Abstract: A program intended to aid in physics education via allowing the proper visualization of graphs and training
  physicists in connecting physical phenomena with their graphical and mathematical representations.
</p>
<p>Impact: Provides educators and curious students with the ability to participate in digital physics labs
  tailored towards their curriculum. Its being open source allows its reach to extend to all who are interested
  in learning physics. </p>

<p><b>The Bipartisan</b> - Dated: 2025-present - Page: <a href="https://thebipartisan.substack.com/">https://thebipartisan.substack.com/</a> </p>
<p>Abstract: A weekly newsletter that I write featuring my analysis of the good and bad of novel republican thought. The point of
  the newsletter is to provide democrats with a republican perspective, as well as perspectives from the general public, so that
  new members of the democratic party can find some compromise between these different perspectives and their own to cultivate 
  interest in the democratic party for the 2028 election year.
</p>
<p>Impact: Provides democrats with the opinions needed to empower an age where they are observant to the 
  needs of the public and, subsequently, the republican party.  </p>

<p><b>Phi Lambda Phi</b> - Dated: 2024-present - Page:<a href="plp.html"> Phi Lambda Phi</a> </p>
<p>Abstract: A collection of guidelines for a student-led philosophy education initiative that aims for students and teachers
  to collaborate on ensuring philosophy education in schools through providing advice and notes on formal philosophy. The goal
  of the program is also to help students apply philosophy to their daily lives in the hopes that they are uplifted via 
  critical thinking and problem solving, something that is best represented by them writing an essay on a topic of their 
  choosing at the end of every year involved in the program.
</p>
<p>Impact: Provides students in public schools with an education in philosophy and the ability to apply this
  education for their own enrichment, as well as the enrichment of their colleagues and the general community. </p>
