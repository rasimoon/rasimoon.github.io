<h2>Short Biography.</h2>
</div>



<p>Hi, I'm Rahsaan. I'm 15, and I live in Clinton, Maryland, and have lived in the DC area
my whole life. I enjoy many things: writing, coding, taking walks, chatting with friends,
watching movies, and more, but above all, I am deeply curious.</p>

<p>Going to boarding school has been a dream of mine since I first stubmled across the opportunity. Although I was hesitant
    in pursuing it at first, I not only feel strongly that the experience will give ample opportunity to satisfy my intellectual curiousity, but I also believe that it will
    give me the ample freedom to explore living independently, community, and learn more academically and from those around me.

    <p id="academic-output">Most of my best academic work comes from the realm of computers. I've had a deep fascination with
      computers since I was young, and have been coding for some time since. Only recently have I been interested in coding with
      AI and doing AI research. As I'm exploring new coding projects I can do, I'm also exploring new subjects that have always been 
      interesting to me, like physics and astronomy. By clicking on one of the buttons in the tab to the left, you will be able 
      to see my projects individually, a short description, and be able to view them through clicking their respective repository or
      "paper" links.

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>

        <p>I plan on doing more research projects in the future and ramping up intensity as I go. Specifically, I would like
          to do projects that may have positive societal implications, like doing research on making AI less harsh for the environment.
          I would also like to complete my research on affective computing and develop an emotionally responsive AI system.

    <p id="personal-output"> Besides personal scientific projects, I also frequently enjoy writing indepedently in the subjects of 
      philosophy and politics. Most of my philosophical writing focuses on the underlying nature of people and the nature of our
      actions. Keeping with this theme, most of my policial writing focuses on broader trends within people who
      participate and oversee the government, as well as the systems of government themselves, with an overarching theme of calling for unity
      and collaboration.

        <p>One thing I have not yet done is have an essay or series of essays that are not self-published. In the future, I would like
          to work on a dedicated series of essays in either philosophy, politics, or a combination of the two, and have them published
          so that my work has a greater chance of being impactful.

    <p id="community-output"> The first club I've ever been a part of was an envrionmental club from my middle school. In this club, I paritcipated in envrionmental and community education
  projects that were both fun and useful. When I got to high school, I would eventually remember my middle school club experience, and decide to explore extracurricular opportunities
  to again find something (or make something) fun and useful. Since then, I have happily undertaken projects and participate in club acitvities that have proved vital to the improvement of my community, both locally and 
  nationally.

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>

        <p>In addition to doing more general community service, I specifically plan to focus on the expansion of the Philosophy Honor Society
          so as to benefit as many communities and inspire as many as possible through applied philosophy. I also want to focus on project TEAL more and forming 
          compelling arguments to legislators for the guarantee of civics education and subsequently a more general and peaceful participation in 
          government and politics.
